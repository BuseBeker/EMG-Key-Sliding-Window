# EMG Key Sliding Window
Create a code and report to navigate the EMG dataset to show ML classification result and current label with keyboard control.

1- Perform machine learning with a separate code and extract a model. Design a model that will have over 95% accuracy using max 5 features. The window width will be determined by you (do not exceed 1000), but the hop or stride value must be fixed at 50. Save the code. Report description of the model, feature extraction and your achievement, and the model you extracted.

2- Your keyboard-controlled sliding window program will consist of two subplot parts. subplot (211) or the upper part will be a time domain plot of raw EMG signals. The actual label value will be displayed in the title of this section. subplot (212) will the features you are using. The expected label value will be displayed in the title of this section. Integrate the model you have obtained into the keyboard-controlled program and take sample screenshots of the correct and incorrect guesses during its operation for report.
